# Installation

I recommend installing inside a virtual environment.

You will need to have jupyter-notebook installed locally.

`pip install jupyter`

Install the dependencies:

`pip install dask numpy graphviz matplotlib`

Run jupyter-notebook:

`jupyter-notebook`

Navigate to the repository and open the Dask_Demo notebook.
